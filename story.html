                        Just a couple of buddies with dreams of owning and operating their very own bar, The View Bar was established in 2019 and quickly became one of the hottest off the strip bars in Henderson. 
                    <br>We opened The View Bar with the intention of creating a new gathering place for good food, good drink and good company that feels like it has always been there. Keeping with the traditions and aesthetics of this one-of-a-kind area, The View Bar is a neighborhood bar for a different kind of neighborhood. Not to mention, our beautiful view of the Las Vegas Strip is a breathtaking sight to see with your favorite beer in hand! We offer a wide variety of draft and craft beers, speciality cocktails, and a small selection of wine. 
                    <br>We also offer live music every Friday and a daily happy hour from 4-6 pm. Come one, come all! </p>
